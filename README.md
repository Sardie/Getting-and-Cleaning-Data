For Assignment of Getting and Cleaning Data course

The "run_analysis.R" file should be sourced into the working directory using the "source" command.

The script assumes that the working directory is the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory. Please change your working directory appropriately for the script to work if you haven't done so.

After "sourcing" the R file, run code "run_analysis()"

The process will take a while.... 

After the function has completed running, a txt file (the final product) called "Tidy_data.txt" will be produced in the working directory.
